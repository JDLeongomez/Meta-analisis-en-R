  abstract = {Reviews the history of the Big Five taxonomy of personality trait dimensions, including the discovery of the five dimensions (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness), research replicating and extending the model, its convergence with research in the questionnaire tradition, and the development of several instruments to measure the Big Five. The authors then compare three of the most frequently used instruments (P. T. Costa and R. R. McCrae's (1992) NEO Personality Inventory instruments, L. R. Goldberg's (1992) Trait Descriptive Adjectives, and O. P. John, E. M. Donohue, and B. L. Kentle's (1991) Big Five Inventory) and report data regarding their reliability and convergent validity. Finally, they address a number of critical issues, including how the Big Five taxonomy is structured hierarchically, whether the five dimensions predict important life outcomes, how they develop, how they combine into personality types, and whether they are descriptive or explanatory concepts.
