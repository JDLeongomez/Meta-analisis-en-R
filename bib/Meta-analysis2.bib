If published studies are chosen, say through a literature review, then an inherent selection bias may arise, because, for example, studies may tend to be published more readily if they are statistically significant, or deemed to be more ``interesting'' in terms of the impact of their outcomes. We develop a simple rank-based data augmentation technique, formalizing the use of funnel plots, to estimate and adjust for the numbers and outcomes of missing studies. Several nonparametric estimators are proposed for the number of missing studies, and their properties are developed analytically and through simulations. We apply the method to simulated and epidemiological datasets and show that it is both effective and consistent with other criteria in the literature.},

We show that they provide effective and relatively powerful tests for evaluating the existence of such publication bias. After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely.

Unfortunately, traditional meta-regression methods are ill-equipped to handle the complex and often unknown correlations among non-independent effect sizes.

The robumeta package provides functions for performing robust variance meta-regression using both large and small sample RVE estimators under various weighting schemes. These methods are distribution free and provide valid point estimates, standard errors and hypothesis tests even when the degree and structure of dependence between effect sizes is unknown.},

Most clustering done in practice is based largely on heuristic but intuitively reasonable procedures, and most clustering methods available in commercial software are also of this type. However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology and discuss recent developments in model-based clustering for non-Gaussian data, high-dimensional datasets, large datasets, and Bayesian estimation.},

The authors then compare three of the most frequently used instruments (P. T. Costa and R. R. McCrae's (1992) NEO Personality Inventory instruments, L. R. Goldberg's (1992) Trait Descriptive Adjectives, and O. P. John, E. M. Donohue, and B. L. Kentle's (1991) Big Five Inventory) and report data regarding their reliability and convergent validity. Finally, they address a number of critical issues, including how the Big Five taxonomy is structured hierarchically, whether the five dimensions predict important life outcomes, how they develop, how they combine into personality types, and whether they are descriptive or explanatory concepts.

We present a new method for visualizing between-study heterogeneity using combinatorial meta-analysis. The method is based on performing separate meta-analyses on all possible subsets of studies in a meta-analysis. We use the summary effect sizes and other statistics produced by the all-subsets meta-analyses to generate graphs that can be used to investigate heterogeneity, identify influential studies, and explore subgroup effects. This graphical approach complements alternative graphical explorations of data. We apply the method to numerous biomedical examples, to allow readers to develop intuition on the interpretation of the all-subsets graphical display. The proposed graphical approach may be useful for exploratory data analysis in systematic reviews. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.

  abstract = {Meta-analysis is a popular approach in the psychological sciences for synthesizing data across studies. However, the credibility of meta-analysis outcomes depends on the evidential value of studies included in the body of evidence used for data synthesis. One important consideration for determining a study?s evidential value is the statistical power of the study?s design/statistical test combination for detecting hypothetical effect sizes of interest. Studies with a design/test combination that cannot reliably detect a wide range of effect sizes are more susceptible to questionable research practices and exaggerated effect sizes. Therefore, determining the statistical power for design/test combinations for studies included in meta-analyses can help researchers make decisions regarding confidence in the body of evidence. Because the one true population effect size is unknown when hypothesis testing, an alternative approach is to determine statistical power for a range of hypothetical effect sizes. This tutorial introduces the metameta R package and web app, which facilitates the straightforward calculation and visualization of study-level statistical power in meta-analyses for a range of hypothetical effect sizes. Readers will be shown how to reanalyze data using information typically presented in meta-analysis forest plots or tables and how to integrate the metameta package when reporting novel meta-analyses. A step-by-step companion screencast video tutorial is also provided to assist readers using the R package.},

Studies investigating the correlation between R/S (eg, beliefs, experiences, coping) and mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, well being) in cancer have used very heterogeneous measures and have produced correspondingly inconsistent results. A meaningful synthesis of these findings has been lacking; thus, the objective of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of the research on R/S and mental health. Four electronic databases were systematically reviewed, and 2073 abstracts met initial selection criteria. Reviewer pairs applied standardized coding schemes to extract indices of the correlation between R/S and mental health. In total, 617 effect sizes from 148 eligible studies were synthesized using meta-analytic generalized estimating equations, and subgroup analyses were performed to examine moderators of effects. The estimated mean correlation (Fisher z) was 0.19 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.23), which varied as a function of R/S dimensions: affective R/S (z = 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.33-0.43), behavioral R/S (z = 0.03; 95\% CI, -0.02-0.08), cognitive R/S (z = 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.06-0.14), and `other' R/S (z = 0.08; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.13). Aggregate, study-level demographic and clinical factors were not predictive of the relation between R/S and mental health. There was little indication of publication or reporting biases. The correlation between R/S and mental health generally was positive. The strength of that correlation was modest and varied as a function of the R/S dimensions and mental health domains assessed. The identification of optimal R/S measures and more sophisticated methodological approaches are needed to advance research.

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

Copas proposed a~selection model to assess the sensitivity of meta-analysis conclusions to possible selection bias. An alternative proposal is the trim-and-fill method. This article reports an empirical comparison of the two methods. Study Design and Setting We took 157 meta-analyses with binary outcomes, analyzed each one using both methods, then performed an automated comparison of the results. We compared the treatment estimates, standard errors, associated P-values, and number of missing studies estimated by both methods. Results Both methods give similar point estimates, but standard errors and P-values are systematically larger for the trim-and-fill method. Furthermore, P-values from the trim-and-fill method are typically larger than those from the usual random effects model when no selection bias is detected. By contrast, P-values from the Copas selection model and the usual random effects model are similar in this setting. The trim-and-fill method reports more missing studies than the Copas selection model, unless selection bias is detected when the position is reversed. Conclusions The assumption that the most extreme studies are missing leads to excessively conservative inference in practice for the trim-and-fill method. The Copas selection model appears to be the preferable approach.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes small-study effects in meta-analysis and how the issues they raise may be addressed. ``Small-study effects'' is a generic term for the phenomenon that smaller studies sometimes show different, often larger, treatment effects than large ones. This notion was coined by Sterne et al. [55]. One possible, probably the most well-known, reason is publication bias. This is said to occur when the chance of a smaller study being published is increased if it shows a stronger effect [3, 41, 52]. This can happen for a number of reasons, for example authors may be more likely to submit studies with ``significant'' results for publication or journals may be more likely to publish smaller studies if they have ``significant'' results. If this occurs, it in turn biases the results of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. There are a number of other possible reasons for small-study effects. One is selective reporting of the most favourable outcomes, known as outcome selection bias or outcome reporting bias [8, 9, 18, 61]. Another possible cause of small-study effects is clinical heterogeneity between patients in large and small studies; e.g., patients in smaller studies may have been selected so that a favourable outcome of the experimental treatment may be expected. In the case of a binary outcome, also a mathematical artefact arises from the fact that for the odds ratio or the risk ratio, the variance of the treatment effect estimate is not independent of the estimate itself [47]. This problem will be discussed in Sect. 5.2.2. Lastly, it can never be ruled out that small-study effects result from mere coincidence [42]. Empirical studies have established evidence for these and other kinds of bias [19, 42, 53]. There is a vast range of tests for small-study effects [4, 20, 24, 38, 43, 48], most of them based on a funnel plot which will be introduced in Sect. 5.1.1.},

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that evaluated interventions to prevent falls and injuries were included. The intervention had to be delivered to individual patients, not at a community or population level. It also had to be service based in an emergency department, primary care, or the community. Control groups could receive standard care or no fall prevention. The outcomes included the number of fallers and fall related injuries.1 In total 19 trials were identified. Of these, eight reported fall related injuries. When combined across trials, the risk for fall related injuries was reduced after the intervention compared with the control, but not significantly (relative risk 0.90, 95\% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.20). Tests of statistical heterogeneity for the meta-analysis of fall related injuries gave the following results: {$\chi$}2=15.77, degrees of freedom=7, P=0.03 (Cochran's Q test), I2=55.6\% (Higgins's I2 test statistic). Subgroup analyses using a test of interaction based on Cochran's Q test were subsequently performed. The resulting P values were: P=0.75 for site of delivery (hospital v community); P=0.75 for whether a doctor was included in the team (yes v no); and P=0.52 for whether trial participants had been selected because they were at high risk of falls (yes v no). The study concluded that there was limited evidence that multifactorial fall prevention programmes in primary care, community, or emergency care settings were effective in reducing the number of fallers or fall related injuries.

  abstract = {Publication bias is a type of systematic error when synthesizing evidence that cannot represent the underlying truth. Clinical studies with favorable results are more likely published and thus exaggerate the synthesized evidence in meta-analyses. The trim-and-fill method is a popular tool to detect and adjust for publication bias. Simulation studies have been performed to assess this method, but they may not fully represent realistic settings about publication bias. Based on real-world meta-analyses, this article provides practical guidelines and recommendations for using the trim-and-fill method. We used a worked illustrative example to demonstrate the idea of the trim-and-fill method, and we reviewed three estimators (R0, L0, and Q0) for imputing missing studies. A resampling method was proposed to calculate P values for all 3 estimators. We also summarized available meta-analysis software programs for implementing the trim-and-fill method. Moreover, we applied the method to 29,932 meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and empirically evaluated its overall performance. We carefully explored potential issues occurred in our analysis. The estimators L0 and Q0 detected at least one missing study in more meta-analyses than R0, while Q0 often imputed more missing studies than L0. After adding imputed missing studies, the significance of heterogeneity and overall effect sizes changed in many meta-analyses. All estimators generally converged fast. However, L0 and Q0 failed to converge in a few meta-analyses that contained studies with identical effect sizes. Also, P values produced by different estimators could yield different conclusions of publication bias significance. Outliers and the pre-specified direction of missing studies could have influential impact on the trim-and-fill results. Meta-analysts are recommended to perform the trim-and-fill method with great caution when using meta-analysis software programs. Some default settings (e.g., the choice of estimators and the direction of missing studies) in the programs may not be optimal for a certain meta-analysis; they should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to examine effects of different estimators and outlying studies.

  abstract = {Journals tend to publish only statistically significant evidence, creating a scientific record that markedly overstates the size of effects. We provide a new tool that corrects for this bias without requiring access to nonsignificant results. It capitalizes on the fact that the distribution of significant p values, p-curve, is a function of the true underlying effect. Researchers armed only with sample sizes and test results of the published findings can correct for publication bias. We validate the technique with simulations and by reanalyzing data from the Many-Labs Replication project. We demonstrate that p-curve can arrive at conclusions opposite that of existing tools by reanalyzing the meta-analysis of the ``choice overload'' literature.},

  abstract = {When the process of publication favors studies with smallp-values, and hence large effect estimates, combined estimates from many studies may be biased. This paper describes a model for estimation of effect size when there is selection based on one-tailedp-values. The model employs the method of maximum likelihood in the context of a mixed (fixed and random) effects general linear model for effect sizes. It offers a test for the presence of publication bias, and corrected estimates of the parameters of the linear model for effect magnitude. The model is illustrated using a well-known data set on the benefits of psychotherapy.},

The authors review the implications of publication bias for quantitative research synthesis (meta-analysis) and describe existing techniques for detecting and correcting it. A new approach is proposed that is suitable for application to meta-analytic data sets that are too small for the application of existing methods. The model estimates parameters relevant to fixed-effects, mixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis contingent on a hypothetical pattern of bias that is fixed independently of the data. The authors illustrate this approach for sensitivity analysis using 3 data sets adapted from a commonly cited reference work on research synthesis (H. M. Cooper \& L. V. Hedges, 1994).},
